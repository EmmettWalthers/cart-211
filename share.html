        <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Sharing Says More Than You Think</h3>
            <p>When you share a post, you’re telling the platform what you believe is worth spreading. 
            This one action helps map out your values, interests, and social identity. Sharing reveals 
            what you support publicly, who influences you, and the ideas you want others to see. Even 
            if the content seems harmless, the act of sharing becomes a clear signal about what matters 
            to you.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="info-card">
            <h3>What Your Share Reveals</h3>
            <p>Sharing connects your profile to specific topics, communities, and belief systems. It shows 
            platforms what you want to promote, what you find important, and what kind of information you 
            think others should pay attention to. This can be used to categorize you into behavioral or 
            ideological groups, influencing the content and ads you receive.</p>

        <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Why Companies Analyze Your Shares</h3>
            <p>Shared content spreads fast, and companies study it to understand what captures attention 
            and moves through social networks. Your shares help reveal how ideas travel, who influences you, 
            and who you influence in return. This shapes recommendation systems, determines what trends are 
            pushed, and guides advertisers seeking people who amplify the right messages.</p>
