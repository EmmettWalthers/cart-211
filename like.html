            <h3>What a Like Really Means</h3>
            <p>When you tap “Like,” it feels quick and harmless, but platforms treat it as a powerful piece of data. 
            A single reaction is saved, analyzed, and compared to millions of others. Every like helps companies 
            map out what interests you, how you think, and what keeps you scrolling. Even if you forget about it 
            instantly, the platform doesn’t.</p>

            <h3>What a Like Reveals</h3>
            <p>A single like can reveal more than you expect. It shows what topics capture your attention, which creators 
            influence you, and how you react emotionally to different kinds of content. Over time, these tiny signals form 
            a detailed profile that can predict your habits, preferences, and interests with surprising accuracy.</p>

            <h3>Why Companies Want Your Likes</h3>
            <p>Likes are easy for machines to process. They train algorithms, shape your feed, influence what you’re shown next, 
            and help advertisers target people who behave like you. To the platform, a like isn’t a simple tap—it’s a measurable 
            indicator of what you care about, and that information is incredibly valuable.</p>
