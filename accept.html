            <h3>You allow a lot more than you think</h3>
            <p>Accepting terms and conditions without reading them can be surprisingly dangerous. 
              Hidden inside long, boring legal text, companies can slip in permissions that give 
              them access to your data, your behavior, and sometimes even your identity. With a single 
              click, you might be agreeing to data tracking, invasive analytics, unwanted charges, or 
              the sharing of your personal information with third parties. Most users don’t realize how 
              much power they hand over, often until it’s too late. Your consent is valuable, and giving 
              it away blindly can have real consequences.</p>
