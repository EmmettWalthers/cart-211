            <h3>Synopsis</h3>
            <p>The website I created is built around the idea of honesty, specifically, 
                the kind that companies avoid when it comes to how they track and use our 
                information. I’ve titled the website “If Companies Were Honest.” As you move 
                through the pages, you’re taken on a “journey” that shows the consequences of 
                hitting different buttons on social media (such as sharing to a friend), 
                filling out forms with personal information, and accepting terms and conditions 
                without fully reading them. These are everyday actions that we do without 
                realizing how much of an impact they have on our privacy. Companies watch what we 
                click, how long we hover, what we ignore, and what we quickly accept. They take 
                this information and sell it online or use it to target us with certain ads, videos, 
                and content. My goal is to show people that these simple actions we don’t think about 
                are being watched very carefully, and often used against us.</p>
