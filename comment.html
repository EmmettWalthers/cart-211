        <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Your Words Aren’t Just Words</h3>
            <p>When you type out a comment, you’re doing more than sharing your opinion.
            Platforms run your text through algorithms that analyze tone, topic, intent,
            and emotional state. Your comment becomes a data point that reveals how you
            think, what triggers your reactions, and how you communicate with others.
            Even deleted comments can remain stored in platform logs.</p>

        <div class="info-card">
            <h3>What Your Comment Reveals</h3>
            <p>Comments expose far more than you might expect. They show your personality,
            interests, beliefs, and even your mood. Certain keywords can flag your
            comment for deeper analysis or categorize you into specific psychological
            or behavioral groups. The way you write, how fast, your style, punctuation. All of 
            this can indicate different emotions.</p>
        </div>

            <h3>Why Companies Analyze Your Comments</h3>
            <p>Comments help companies measure engagement and emotional response at a
            deeper level. They reveal what sparks discussion, what content spreads,
            and which users are the most expressive. This information trains algorithms,
            influences what shows up in your feed, and helps advertisers target specific
            emotional states. Your comment isn’t just text, it’s a behavioral signal.</p>
